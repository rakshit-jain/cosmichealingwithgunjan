        <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 27, 2025</p>

            <h2>Appointment Cancellation and Rescheduling</h2>
            <p>At Akashic Healing & NLP Therapy, we value your time and understand that circumstances may arise that require you to cancel or reschedule your appointment. We have implemented the following cancellation policy to ensure fair treatment for all clients and to maintain our scheduling efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Standard Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>For all services (Akashic Record Readings, NLP Therapy, and Integrated Healing):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>48+ Hours Notice:</strong> If you cancel or reschedule with at least 48 hours' notice before your scheduled appointment, you will receive a full refund or have the option to reschedule without any additional fee.</li>
                <li><strong>24-48 Hours Notice:</strong> If you cancel or reschedule between 24 and 48 hours before your appointment, you will be charged 50% of the session fee, or may reschedule once at no additional cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Less than 24 Hours Notice:</strong> If you cancel or reschedule with less than 24 hours' notice, or if you do not show up for your scheduled appointment, you will be charged the full session fee.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Cancel or Reschedule</h2>
            <p>To cancel or reschedule your appointment, please:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:cosmichealing@gmail.com">cosmichealing@gmail.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that cancellation requests are only considered valid once you receive a confirmation from us.</p>

            <h2>Late Arrivals</h2>
            <p>If you arrive late for your appointment, your session will still end at the scheduled time, and you will be charged the full session fee. We maintain this policy out of respect for both our practitioners and other clients.</p>

            <h2>Emergency Cancellations</h2>
            <p>We understand that genuine emergencies can occur. In cases of serious illness, family emergency, or other extraordinary circumstances, we may waive the cancellation fee at our discretion. Please contact us as soon as possible and provide relevant documentation if requested.</p>

            <h2>Package Sessions and Pre-paid Services</h2>
            <p>If you've purchased a package of sessions or pre-paid for multiple appointments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The standard cancellation policy applies to each individual session within the package</li>
                <li>A missed session or late cancellation will result in the forfeiture of that session from your package</li>
                <li>Package sessions must be used within six months of purchase unless otherwise specified</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Online Sessions</h2>
            <p>Our cancellation policy applies equally to both in-person and online sessions. For online sessions, it is your responsibility to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test your technology setup in advance of the appointment</li>
                <li>Ensure you have a stable internet connection</li>
                <li>Be in a quiet, private space for the duration of the session</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Technical difficulties on your end that prevent the session from taking place will be treated as a regular appointment and subject to our standard cancellation policy.</p>

            <h2>Practitioner Cancellations</h2>
            <p>In the rare event that we need to cancel your appointment due to illness, emergency, or unforeseen circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will notify you as soon as possible</li>
                <li>You will be offered the option to reschedule or receive a full refund</li>
                <li>If appropriate, we may offer a complimentary service addition to your rescheduled appointment as compensation for the inconvenience</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Refunds will be processed according to the cancellation policy outlined above and will be issued using the same method of payment used for the original transaction. Please allow 5-7 business days for refunds to be processed and appear in your account.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this cancellation policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on our website and will apply to appointments booked after the posting date.</p>
